# Contributing a patch

The steps to contribute a change are:

* Fork the vscode-websearch repository and clone to your local machine.
* Make your changes on your machine, ensure the extention runs successfully, and commit your changes.
* Push the commits to your fork. This way your name will be the author of the commit in the main vscode-websearch tree (once the commits are pulled into the main tree).
* Create a pull request on Github, this will initiate a code review and CLA signing request
* We will review, and possibly request changes, to your PR
* Once all comments/questions/concerns have been addressed, your PR will be merged.

Also, [Collaborative Github Workflow](http://www.eqqon.com/index.php/Collaborative_Github_Workflow) has a very good description of the workflow and tips and tricks when contributing to a project hosted on GitHub.
